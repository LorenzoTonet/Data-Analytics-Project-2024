# Data-Analytics-Project-2024

This repository contaons the final project for the "Data Analytics" course for the bachelor's degree program in "Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics." We
conduct an exploratory analysis of the dataset "Life expectancy" in the R programming language in this project.  The overall analysis is in the html file "Final
document" while the script in R markdown used to generate it is in the file "Data Analysis." Script contains only the code part without any formatting or comments.
